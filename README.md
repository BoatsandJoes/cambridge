Cambridge
=========

Welcome to Cambridge, the next open-source falling-block game engine!

This fork is written and maintained exclusively by [SashLilac](https://github.com/SashLilac)!


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Pre-built releases are available on the releases page.

### Windows

Unzip the exe file and run it directly. All assets are currently bundled inside the executable.

### macOS

For the time being, the file `cambridge.love` only works on the command line. Install `love` with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and run:

    $ love cambridge.love

### Linux

Same as macOS, except install `love` with your favourite package manager.


Running from source
-------------------

If you want the bleeding-edge release, you can also clone the code straight from this repository.

### macOS, Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're using LÃ–VE 11, because it won't work with earlier versions!**

Clone the repository in git:

    git clone https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge

Then, navigate to the root directory that you just cloned, and type:

    love .

It should run automatically!
