Playing the game
----------------

### macOS, Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're using LÖVE 11, because it won't work with earlier versions!**

Clone the repository in git:

	git clone https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge

Alternatively, download the source code ZIP in the latest release.

Then, navigate to the root directory that you just cloned, and type:

	love .

It should run automatically!

## Windows

You do not need LÖVE on Windows, as it comes bundled with the program. Download the source code ZIP in the latest release, or if you want the bleeding edge version, download [this](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/archive/master.zip).

Extract the ZIP, open a Command Prompt at the folder you extracted Cambridge to, then run this command:

	dist\windows\love.exe .

Alternatively, if you're on a 32-bit system, run this instead:

	dist\win32\love.exe .

32-bit systems do not support rich presence integration.
