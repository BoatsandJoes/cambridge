Phantom Mania 2
===============

The Phantom Mania mode in Nullpomino is based on T.A. Death (Speed Mania), but where everything is invisible. The obvious sequel to such a mode is Phantom Mania 2, which is based on Shirase (Speed Mania 2), but again where everything is invisible.



Gameplay
--------

The goal of this game is to reach the end at level 1300, and then score as many grades as possible in the ending credit roll.

Each piece disappears as soon as it is placed down. Only the active piece is visible at any given time.

Every piece placed increases the level by 1, and every line cleared also increases the level by 1, with bonuses for large numbers of lines:

| Lines cleared | Levels advanced |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 6 |

When the current level reaches one less than the level at the bottom of the display (usually a multiple of 100), the level will not advance until a line is cleared.


Levels
------

Each section is 100 levels long. At certain levels, the speed may get faster, or the difficulty may increase some other way.

| Level | What happens |
|-------|------------|
|   500 | Rows of garbage start to advance on the board. The bottom row is copied, appearing for a brief flash before disappearing again. |
|  1000 | The garbage stops, but the hold queue turns invisible. |
|  1100 | The first next preview turns invisible. |
|  1200 | The second next preview turns invisible. |

Unlike in Shirase mode, the speed of the game does not get faster past level 1000.

### Torikans

There are certain checkpoints at which your current time will be checked and you will be stopped if your time is over a set objective time.

| Level | Time limit |
|-------|------------|
|   300 |   2:02.00  |
|   500 |   3:03.00  |
|   800 |   4:45.00  |
|  1000 |   5:38.00  |

At each torikan, you will get a 54-second invisible roll which is worth grade points.

Only the 1300 roll is in Big Mode.


Grading
-------

Your grade starts at 1, and goes on from S1 to S9, and then M1 upwards indefinitely.

Your grade advances each section based on your section time. If you achieve a section COOL, you get 2 grade points. If you instead incur a section REGRET, you get no grade points. The normal section time (in between COOL and REGRET) is worth one grade point.

| Level | Section COOL | Section REGRET |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
|  0-4  |     36.00    |      48.00     |
|  5-9  |     30.00    |      39.00     |
| 10-12 |     27.00    |      35.00     |


Then, the invisible roll is also worth grade points.

| Lines cleared | Grade points |
|---------------|--------------|
|       1       |     0.02     |
|       2       |     0.06     |
|       3       |     0.15     |
|       4       |     0.40     |
|     Clear     |     1.00     |


The number of grade points you earn correspond to your grade as follows:

| Points |  Grade |
|--------|--------|
|    0   |    1   |
|    1   |   S1   |
|    2   |   S2   |
|    3   |   S3   |
|    4   |   S4   |
|    5   |   S5   |
|    6   |   S6   |
|    7   |   S7   |
|    8   |   S8   |
|    9   |   S9   |
|   10   |   m1   |
|   11   |   m2   |
|   12   |   m3   |
|   13   |   m4   |
|   14   |   m5   |

And so on. For *x* > 9 grade points, your grade is m(*x*-9).

If you achieve a section COOL on each section, your rank will be m17 entering the credit roll.
