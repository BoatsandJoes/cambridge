Game modes
==========

There are several classes of game modes.


MARATHON
--------

Modes in which the goal is to play as well as possible over a limited game interval, to ultimately achieve the title of Grand Master.

* **MARATHON 2020**: 2020 levels of pure pain. Can you make it all the way?

From other games:
* **MARATHON A1**: Tetris the Grand Master 1.
* **MARATHON A2**: Tetris the Grand Master 2 (TAP Master).
* **MARATHON A3**: Tetris the Grand Master 3 (no exams).


SURVIVAL
--------

Modes that concentrate on how long you can survive an increasingly fast and difficult game.

* **SURVIVAL 2020**: It only gets worse from Marathon 2020. Beware of the total delay!

From other games:
* **SURVIVAL A1**: 20G mode from Tetris the Grand Master.
* **SURVIVAL A2**: T.A. Death.
* **SURVIVAL A3**: Ti Shirase.


PHANTOM MANIA
-------------

Modes where pieces turn invisible as soon as you lock them. One of Cambridge's signature features.

* **Phantom Mania**: The classic invisible mode from Nullpomino. Can you handle 999 levels of "the M roll"?

* **Phantom Mania 2**: Phantom Mania but way faster! Can you face a mode where even the garbage and the next preview turn invisible?


OTHER MODES
-----------

* **Strategy**: How well can you plan ahead your movements? Can you handle only having a short time to place each piece?

* **TetrisGramâ„¢ Pacer Test**: is a multi-stage piece-placing ability test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.

* **Interval Training**: 30 seconds per section. 20G. 15 frames of lock delay. How long can you last?
